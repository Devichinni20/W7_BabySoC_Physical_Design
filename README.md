# W7_BabySoC_Physical_Design

**OpenROAD + noVNC Cloud Environment**
This repository launches a **ready-to-use GitHub Codespace** with OpenROAD tools, an XFCE desktop, and browser-based **noVNC** access.  
It is designed for testing and learning **physical design (PD) flows** in a cloud-based environment — without needing any local installation.
